These are the computer codes used in **'Interpretable prediction of drug synergy for breast cancer by random forest with features from Boolean modeling of signaling pathways'** by Kittisak Taoma, Marasri Ruengjitchatchawalya, Kanthida Kusonmano, Teerasit Termsaithong, Thana Sutthibutpong, Monrudee Liangruksa, Teeraphan Laomettachit.

'Ensembled_RF.ipynb' trains five random forest models, evaluates model performance, extracts feature importance, and performs accumulated local effects (ALE) analysis of the features.

'MCF7_AKT_GoF_mutation.ipynb' calculates the protein contributions to the HSA score of AZD5363 + Fulvestrant when treated on the MCF-7 AKT-GoF cell line.

'M468_PTEN_GoF_mutation.ipynb' calculates the protein contributions to the HSA score of 391210-10-9 + Stattic when treated on the MDA-MB-468 PTEN-GoF cell line.
